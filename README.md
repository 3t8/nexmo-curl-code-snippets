# Curl examples for Nexmo APIs

This repository is a collection of cURL examples for working with the Nexmo API Platform.  If you're not already familiar with Nexmo, check out our [Developer Portal](https://developer.nexmo.com) for more information.


## Quick start

If you're already registered and just looking to try some of these examples:
* Copy `config.sh` to `config.local.sh` and add your own values.  You can find your API key and secret on the [Nexmo dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
* Run any example `*.sh` file with a command like this: `./example-file.sh` containing the filename you're interested in.

| Don't forget to tell us what you build!  Open an issue (or a pull request) if there's any other examples you'd like to see, we love to hear from you :)
